				<p>> Choosing a Social Network Wisely<br><br>
					You might only have an audience on two social networks.Choosing a social network wisely.
					You do not have to be on every social media site. You need to understand where our audience
					is and what they think of us.
				</p>
				<p>> Create and use a content calendar<br><br>
					Give your audience interesting, meaty content - they are waiting for it. Don't let them down.
					Success doesn't just happen by accident. An effective social media strategy is comprised of both
					planning and execution.
				</p>
				<p>> Increase your engagement<br><br>
					Connect with your customers via social media once you've created a content plan. Make sure
					you add them first. Find and follow a customer you met at a recent event, or add them as
					a friend if you had a great conversation with them. Become engaged with them.
